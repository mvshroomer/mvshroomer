- Hiya, I’m @mvshroomer
- I am working on a bunch of personal projects that usually have to do with video games and websites.
- I know a bit of most of the big languages (C++/C, Python, Javascript/HTML/CSS, SQL, even LOLCode...).
- I would collaborate on some robotics/scientific/video game based projects. It is not my interest to do anything with AI. Personal preference.
- I'm on YouTube (ProjectShroom)and Discord (mvshroomer). I want to do videos on projects of mine so that's kinda the vibes with that.
